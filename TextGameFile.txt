Court Yard
You drive up to the large fence at the edge of the road. '1643' it reads.
Yup, this is the correct address. The gates automatically open as if they knew
you were trying to pull in. The driveway is lengthy and the castle comes into view.
You park your car and get out. Taking a look around there is a strange open feild to
your right with a shed, and a staircase up to a large wooden door.

Home
You get back into your car, and drive away. You think to yourself 'Yes this was the
right decision, I didnt want to go on an adventure anyways.' You arrive home at 
your house where your cat named norman greets you. You feed norman, get in your 
bed, and live the rest of your unfulfilling life while wondering what could've 
happened that day.

Shed
For some reason, even though youre only there to interview the owner of the castle,
you decide it would be a smart idea to inspect everything. You walk up to the shed
and look around. There are peices of rotting wood falling off of the side of the
 structure. You open the door slowly, just to be sure the roof doesnt come caving in
on you. You peer inside expecting something horrible only to find its filled with
normal things that you would find inside of a shed. Tools and such. 'Glad I took
the time out of my day to look at this' you think to yourself.

Front room
You walk up to the giant wooden door. You could see the golden knockers
from a distance, but now that you're closer you can finally make out that they're in the
shape of a goat with two large horns and a symbol on the middle of its head. It's odd but
you shake it and raise your fist to knock. As your hand strikes the door, it pushes it open.
As if there was no friction whatsoever the door just opens.
